# FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

My project is going to be a Binary Search Tree that analyzes the data of car brands and models for a dealership. I am going to give the car struct the elements of price, make, model, year, and Condition (new or used). Within this Binary search tree, I am going to make functions so that that the user can search for cars by each individual aspect, add cars, and perhaps change elements such as price and condition. I am going to use the same style of main menu that is familiar from other past project that will give the options for what to do and then take the normal user input.

How to Run
-To run, you must compile the main.cpp files along with the attached class of Cars.cpp and Cars.h.
-Once it is compiled the menu is operated by inputing the number or words that you are prompted for in each stage of the menu.
-Be sure to watch your spelling and Capitalization!

Dependencies
-This program depends on a compiler such as codeblocks in order to build and run it.

System Requirements
-This program can be run on any operating system that has the right compiler such as codeblocks.
