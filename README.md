# FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

My project is going to be a Binary Search Tree that analyzes the data of car brands and models for a dealership. I am going to give the car struct the elements of price, make, model, year, and Condition (new or used). Within this Binary search tree, I am going to make functions so that that the user can search for cars by each individual aspect, add cars, delete cars, and perhaps change elements such as price and condition. I am going to use the same style of main menu that is familiar from other past project that will give the options for what to do and then take the normal user input.
